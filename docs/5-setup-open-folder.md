## #5 Correctly set up the Open Folder button to select a directory and filter out image files
#### Branch name: 5-setup-open-folder

### Task Description:

You need to render images as BufferedImages and make sure to only load a couple at a time. Use a LinkedHashMap to set a limit of, possibly, fifty images.
Make sure that the images are not saved at full resolution. That would use too much memory.
Finally, allow the user to change the grid size, and make sure that the images are all the same aspect ratio when being displayed.
Add a slight border around each image if it looks nice. This might not be necessary.
