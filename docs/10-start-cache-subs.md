## #10 Start developing cache subsystem
#### Branch name: 10-start-cache-subs
[Back](../TODO.md)

### Task Description:
Your task is to make a new class named CacheManager that is able to do the following:
- Store a JSON file that has the following properties:
  - File Path
  - Cache Path

You may want to make the cache file name the original path string (the full absolute path) but as a SHA256 hash. This makes the files traceable.
Finally, add an invalidate/rebuild caches menu option under the "Options..." menu.

There may be more plans for this issue as you work on it. Add things to it as you need, but thoroughly document.
